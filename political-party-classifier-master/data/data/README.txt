Each file "a1.txt", "a2.txt", ..., "a228.txt" represents a speech starting from George Washington ending with President Obama's speech in 2014. 

The transcript of the speech was processed to remove punctuation, remove numbers, and convert the characters all to lowercase.  The files are structured to have one word per line listed.   

The text files "a*.txt" are what you will use in your project.
